# Higgs Boson Decay to Bottom Quarks: A Review

This project provides a detailed review of the observation of the Higgs boson decay into bottom quark-antiquark pairs (H â†’ bb), with a specific focus on processes involving Higgs bosons produced in association with *W* or *Z* bosons (VH production). The analysis consolidates data from CMS measurements at various center-of-mass energies and highlights the significance of these findings in confirming Standard Model predictions.

## Key Highlights
- **Dataset:** Utilized data from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particularly from CMS measurements at 13 TeV, combined with earlier data at 7 and 8 TeV.
- **Methodology:** Applied advanced statistical tools, such as binned-likelihood fits and deep neural networks, to isolate the Higgs signal amidst significant backgrounds.
- **Findings:** Observed an event excess with a combined significance of 5.6Ïƒ, affirming the Higgs boson's decay into bottom quarks and reinforcing the predictions of the Standard Model.

## Contents
A detailed review explaining the theoretical background, experimental setup, methods, and results can be found in the file `HBB.pdf` located in this repository.

## Significance
This study enhances understanding of the Yukawa coupling and the Higgs mechanism's role in mass generation, providing a pathway for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model.
